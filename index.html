<p>When getting started it's probably best to work with a simplified patch, so here we have a single oscillator path: VCO 1, 
EXT/Noise + VCO 1 fed to VCF 1 with Cut Off at zero and Resonance at 100%, set to LPF and modulated by EG1+, fed to VCA 
1 controlled by EG 2 set to a basic envelope with VCA 1's EG Depth at 50%; don't forget to set Brilliance at 50-100%. Such settings 
make your CeeS Cntrl changes more evident as you experiment.</p>
